<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Running the app

This app is not meant for production. Therefore I included the devolopment server in the 
repository. 

### Prerequisites

In the settings file of the app you can find that the database has been changed to postgresql.
To run the app you need to change the database settings and migrate.
Moreover, make sure to set up a virtual environment with the requirements.txt file.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is just me experimenting with different django features. This is not meant to be used.
